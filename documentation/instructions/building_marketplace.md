i'm particularly excited about this panel um about five to ten years ago
0:16
i was basically telling any entrepreneur that had a marketplace idea that it was a terrible idea
0:23
way too hard to bring multiple sides of supply and demand together why do that
0:30
obviously a stupid thing to say because yes amazon did exist then and was doing well
0:36
but we're here to talk about starting a marketplace startup it has unique challenges and
0:41
also incredible rewards and uh i'd love to start with ishwan hi everyone my name is ishwan godfrey
0:47
i'm co-founder and ceo of api we're the modern household manager and we help busy families find book and
0:54
manage in-home care providers on demand hi everyone i'm kenji i'm a co-founder
0:59
of east medesa it's a dating app catering to the asian community in english-speaking countries
1:06
and now we have a live streaming feature which is the fast fastest growing segment in our business
1:12
it grew like four times in uh one year so that's more like a marketplace because we have like a live
1:18
streamer and then our viewers and stuff like what is the live streamer doing for your marketplace
1:23
also they're just like providing entertaining content within the platform and viewers can
1:29
engage with the multiple viewers can engage with the streamer and then they can give digital
1:35
gifts and that's how we monetize thank you yes hello i'm jaden i'm the co-founder
1:41
of pietra so we are a marketplace for creators of high-end physical goods so our first
1:48
category was fine jewelry so we connect people who make and design fine jewelry with people who love it and
1:54
want to buy it great thank you our own amaroon
1:59
i'm the ceo of grailt which is a marketplace for men's clothing and we also run heroine.com with an e
2:05
which is a marketplace for women's clothing hi everybody my name is alpai i'm the
2:12
founder and ceo of kaio kaio is an online marketplace for pre-loved furniture
2:18
both a commitment to great designs exceptional customer care experience and a more sustainable planet we make it
2:24
extremely easy to buy and sell good quality furniture we pick up we clean we photograph we deliver and
2:31
everything is algorithmically priced so you can find great deals on some of your favorite brands so let's say i'll pay
2:37
um let's dive right in how did it start how did you get your first piece of furniture and your first
2:43
customer um the very first few customers
2:49
we're mostly seo and craigslist believe it or not um it still is actually the most
2:55
craigslist is still the most dominant player out there in our industry so what i did was i just reached out to
3:01
a couple of people that i thought might be interested in the service and sure sure enough there was a big
3:07
need for what we were providing the sellers so it was very easy to get that going and we had a pretty strong
3:13
seo background as well so it was pretty easy to lure in the first few customers without
3:18
really spending a whole lot on marketing and so what you what were you adding then to the the value chain you were
3:24
basically able to bring more customers to the craigslist listing by doing the marketing for that listing
3:30
yourself so the big need that we saw that was really the hypothesis of uh kaya which started out under a
3:37
different name furnisher which i know is a nicer name perhaps
3:42
we were just chatting in the back backstage the the big thing that we provide sellers is the pickup
3:48
it's the convenience what we found is that a lot of people have really nice furniture and they're completely detached from it
3:54
it's the largest waste category in the united states actually there's virtually no recycling of furniture in this
3:59
country or in the in the developed world in general so by providing that fast free pickup we
4:04
found that there was a that we were meeting a need that was just unmet so it was really the demand on the
4:11
buyer the the seller side to get rid of the furniture almost more so than the demand on the
4:17
buyer side absolutely we just we saw an opportunity on the south side and our approach still is you know provide the
4:24
best service possible for the supply side if you can corner that market you can figure out what to do on the demand side each one
4:32
more of a services marketplace you bring services and people together how did you make your first match
4:40
we had a handful of providers and we threw up a website and threw in some google adwords and had our first
4:46
customer in the first week that we put on a website so for me what was fascinating was the fact that finding care
4:53
is such a pain point that people are willing to go on to google like that was like the mind-blowing aspect for me it
4:59
was like wow you're willing to go to a new company that you've never heard of you've never even seen our stuff before
5:04
but you are so desperate to find help that you're willing to give us a shot um so i still remember my first client
5:10
stacy called she just gave birth her baby came early her night nurse wasn't starting for another two weeks
5:16
and she was desperate and there was no way that she was spending 20 hours of the new baby at home trying to go
5:21
through 3 000 potential care providers for her so i think what's interesting about our
5:26
business is that unlike my other fellow panelists where there's a lot of fun and joy and looking for furniture for jewelry
5:34
nobody ever said oh i really had a great time on care.com trying to find a babysitter a cook or a
5:40
cleaner so they're really looking for convenience and they're looking for great providers that they can book within minutes and not hours
5:47
are you trying to make the casey schwann that you have the most valuable marketplace i have one that can stick
5:53
with you for the longest let's put it that way but how many you you got your first
5:58
customer on google using google adwords how many options did you have to have
6:05
available to really give her something to buy or a compelling market to choose from yeah so the big differentiation for us
6:12
is that we offer a curated care as a parent myself i often feel like why doesn't these marketplaces just tell me
6:18
they don't have anyone right instead they make me go through 3 000 searches to be like you know what
6:23
not sure i'm not feeling it so we took an early premise that we were going to do a best match and if we couldn't we
6:29
would tell you i'm sorry we don't have a match for you and you you would respect me and come
6:34
back to me for your future searches rather than make me waste 20 hours of your time and then find
6:39
nothing so we today actually offer a curated match based on our proprietary
6:44
algorithms that serve up three to five matches for you and when you made that first match behind
6:51
the scenes behind curation how many offerings did you have we had
6:56
three providers who were serving night nurses at that time i think that's a really fabulous
7:01
takeaway endnote for the other early stage entrepreneurs in the audience yeah i think you don't need a lot you
7:06
just need quality and i think it's just learning and testing um and you know we still do that today
7:12
at a small batch we try to figure out why is it a good match why it isn't and also i think geocentric focused
7:20
i think is very helpful so not to spread yourself too thin geographically where you couldn't make a match we were very focused on manhattan to
7:26
start with it's a great point we'll definitely come back to geography arun do you agree that it's more about
7:32
quality and less about volume yeah totally um especially in the early days because you can't have volume so
7:38
you might as well have quality um i think when i was first starting grailed i was a little bit lucky because
7:43
i was starting it out of behavior that already existed on the internet um men's clothing back in 2010
7:51
2012 wasn't really something that people cared about or talked about a lot so people who were into it kind of had to go online to talk to other people or
7:57
find other people who are interested in as well and in all these sort of communities there were these shadow gray market
8:03
transactions that were happening where somebody was like hey i bought this solidaron jacket final sale it doesn't
8:08
fit me i'm never going to wear it do you want to buy it for like half what i paid or less and i was like in these markets and people were doing this so from i was i
8:15
quickly realized that obviously forums reddit is not the best place to uh do these transactions like images
8:21
take forever to load it's hard to handle over pricing so i was like hey i could build a website that aggregates all these listings together and then
8:27
this marketplace could be 10 20 100 times as big but it was nice because there's already supply out there right it's like people
8:32
were already selling on reddit people already selling on forums so i was able to go to these people who were already selling already had images
8:38
taken of their product already were like motivated to sell their product and be like hey i'll port your images over to
8:43
my website i'll create an account for you i'll do all this stuff and i got to pick which ones i wanted so i curated like maybe 500 listings of
8:50
just like really great product and put it up on the website and the people the sellers who were doing this didn't actually have to do anything
8:55
um and then i launched with like a reddit post or a forum post being like hey i built this marketplace for all of us together to in the community
9:02
to buy and sell stuff to each other um when people went onto the marketplace they were like wow everything on this place is really really
9:08
nice um and you know they don't know if they unless they scroll to the bottom there's only 500 things but even if there are only 500 things
9:14
they're like you know it's 500 awesome things like i should buy something so i think quality is super important okay so 500
9:19
it wasn't 50 it wasn't a thousand did you were you shooting for 500 again going back to the people
9:25
you know who are looking for like what to target what makes sense for their business totally i think getting it out there
9:31
sooner rather than later is super important especially with the marketplace right because if you're not live then like what are
9:36
you doing with the marketplace right like people can't add and like join and sign up and then like you have nothing so you can spend i
9:42
think i mean you know other people should jump in and be like this is what i think but um i think you should spend some amount of time getting initial supply whatever you
9:48
feel like a critical mass of supply is for your marketplace like for a care provider maybe it's three is good enough right and then you can
9:53
get somebody out there but once you get that critical mass of supply you just launch it publicly and then what you wanna do is jumpstart the flywheel
9:59
right so if you can get people saying like hey there is good supply here if i have good supply i should put it here and you get buyers being like hey this
10:05
is a place that i should check then you can sort of like start to like do but it's not as easy as that obviously
10:10
um but you know you can at least start to like create the behavior and see what works right you don't want to hold it too close to the chest you want it to be out in the world so people can like rip
10:16
it apart so you can fix it kenji what was critical mask for east meets east
10:21
it was 100 female first so what happened was that we went even further to focus on certain
10:28
sub-segment within the asian community in the u.s so we focus on one city new york city
10:34
and age between 23 and 28 and also heterosexual female and then
10:41
we make sure that each person is going to be very active on the site they have the needs
10:47
to find someone and you know we personally know these people like through a friend or through a
10:53
social media network we pinpoint them we gave them actually sephora gifts cards just to make sure they you
11:00
know they're going to be active on the site you know it's not like we we're not
11:06
they're real users but they have more incentive to respond
11:11
that's interesting so the sephora gift card came with what kind of how did you kind of message the obligation or ensure
11:16
that they were kind of gonna hold up their end of the deal i didn't want it to be transactional so i just
11:23
know you know when you give someone they want to recirculate right so that's how it works so you were
11:28
nudging a behavior through that creating loyalty if you will yep okay um jaden did you confront these issues
11:36
when you were getting pietra off the ground yeah so i think everyone's point about critical mass
11:42
is really important so critical mass was three it was 500 pieces for us we actually had
11:48
different products within the world of fine jeweler that we could launch in phases so what we did was we actually
11:54
started with the one that had this very very high intent this very clear path which was it's hard
11:59
to find a guy to make an engagement ring for you that was like our first product and it was something that was so crystal clear
12:05
that everyone knew this was a problem nobody could find somebody and so all we needed to get traction was about 15
12:12
engaging ring jewelers and we could find those people in new york in la and chicago we found some in israel
12:17
literally i called everybody i could and we found these people to come on the platform and then we had the next product which
12:24
was make anything custom which she probably needed about 30 people and i'm sorry for the first product what was kind of the traction on
12:30
the consumer side yeah so we put up a few google ads and a few facebook ads very very low cost
12:36
and we just had a ton of interest we had hundreds of people show up to be
12:42
like i want to buy an engagement ring help me do this i want to talk to 10 jewelers at one time and they were and that was the
12:48
the start of all of it um and then from there we kind of said okay this is working really well for
12:53
engagement jewelers let's open this up to designers who can make anything for anybody and he needed maybe 35 40 people to do
13:01
that because it had to feel like there were enough people to handle all of the wacky requests that you get in
13:06
the world because there's so many shapes and forms of jewelry right so like you had to have at least two or three people bidding on
13:13
everything that someone could imagine yeah you probably needed 30 of those people and then the the next product was
13:19
actually just ready to our collections where we had listings of products and it just had to feel full so you had
13:24
15 people on the site were these people with whom you had a personal relationship or were they comfortable coming to the site
13:31
knowing that there was a lot of uncertainty did they have to wait long for a sale how did you kind of keep them primed
13:36
yeah so that's one of the challenges that we faced early on which was like
13:42
300 400 500 requests would come in and the excited jewelers in the
13:47
beginning would just start bidding on all of them because they were super excited and they would get one out of every 20 maybe and so
13:54
the way that we kept them engaged was personal relationships yeah we would call them we would send them flowers we would say thanks so much
14:00
for being a part of this we're building the future together and we lost some of them and we didn't lose some of them and and here we are the
14:06
ones that you lost why did you lose them they just get frustrated with with bidding over and over again and
14:12
they felt like their physical store or their physical business was a better use of their time
14:18
than joining pietra and and attempting to kind of navigate this this new way to do business and how did you earn
14:25
that fabulous name pietra it's funny um so our original name was
14:31
carbon club which my partner rowe came up with um so he and pam my partners were from uber
14:37
i'm from the world of like direct to consumer brands and they uh row had this idea for carbon club and it was because diamonds are
14:43
made of carbon and we all liked the idea um we tested it with a few of our friends
14:48
and we had the opportunity to uh sit down with anna wintour and we pitched her the idea and and
14:54
she's like i like the idea but i don't like your name so we had a few in the tank right we had
14:59
three four or five names and we're just like oh we just started throwing them out at her and i said pietra and she said um pietra
15:06
i like it and so sounds like she could launch a new service that's that's the name that's
15:13
the story i want to stay on the topic of incentives and engagement because i think this is really interesting
15:18
i'll pay when you have how you have to find a new user pretty
15:24
frequently i imagine your sales cycle kind of ends after one piece of furniture so how are you kind of managing um
15:33
the constant marketing to these different potential sellers is it all still through craigslist or
15:39
google adwords at this point it's a pretty mature um variety of channels i
15:46
should say um craigslist believe it or not is still actually a big acquisition channel for us because people are still trying to
15:52
buy and sell there we use quite a bit of adverts quite a bit of traditional marketing on
15:58
sem on google adwords facebook we do some spotify ads we've done subway
16:05
ads in the past we're always testing additional channels direct mail etc arun
16:10
uh your 500 people or 500
16:16
excu items sorry uh your 500 items were you paying people uh
16:22
were you getting paid a commission on those sales or did you just do it for testing totally uh so in the beginning
16:30
i was really concerned with growth obviously and like i wanted to become a thing um and not just die out so i wanted to
16:37
reduce the barriers entry as much as possible so i wasn't getting paid at all and i did that for about a year and a
16:44
half which like it's hard to say if i would like recommend that or not i think now i wouldn't recommend it i think back
16:50
then um i mean now there's people are so used to new services and more willing to use new services that i think it would it's it's it's not
16:57
as hard but i think back then i people were more skeptical i think but now there's like startups popping up everywhere that do everything and like
17:03
it's easier to trust them i think than it was back then um but i was running it for free for maybe two years
17:09
um and then i was so nervous about um about actually charging um and i was worried
17:15
that it would sort of like slow down the growth rate or all that stuff so i waited and we actually we launched um the
17:20
iphone app and um we started charging and then we did like a big promotion like flash sale
17:26
um at the same time but basically bookended charging like between the iphone app and the flash sale so that people are like oh they're charging and
17:32
they're doing this big promotion so kind of like change the news cycle which was actually in hindsight like really unnecessary like
17:38
marketplaces are pretty well like take rates in marketplace is like pretty well established um like etsy was notoriously charging
17:44
3.5 and then getting 15 blended um when they went public i think maybe at least 10 maybe 15
17:50
um and like yeah the the market ebay set the market average at 10 um and i think that that's pretty well
17:55
accepted now by consumers so then looking back should you have charged sooner should you have
18:01
you know i don't think it really matters honestly um we could have charged sooner and i think it would have been fine we could have waited a little bit longer
18:06
and i think it would have been fine um i think every marketplace over the course of its lifetime if you keep growing um increases its take rate over time um
18:14
etsy is a good example um all the new marketplaces are coming out are good examples um you know we'll continue to increase
18:19
our take rate you know as we keep growing as well so i don't know you know it really depends on the economics of your business right
18:25
like if you're doing physical authentication obviously your take rate has to be much higher if you're not then it doesn't right so like you just have to make sure that um you
18:32
just make sure the economics of your business work right that like your cats and your ltvs make sense um and that you can keep acquiring new
18:38
customers through whatever mechanism is the one that you use i'll pay i actually want to just go back to you on the pricing front how does
18:44
your pricing work so we're probably the marketplace out there that charges the most
18:49
of any marketplace out there um we our take rates actually start at 60 and goes
18:54
up from there but we let the customers actually pick it so if you're selling with us you tell us what percentage of the um of
19:02
the proceeds you want to receive and in return for that our algorithm basically has will provide you a higher chance of
19:08
getting that fast free pickup again um you let your customers decide how much they want to pay you
19:14
correct it's pretty unique but again it goes back to what's the spread like between like can i can i charge zero to
19:20
40 percent zero what if i pick zero what happens yeah it's most likely that it's going to get picked up but there's
19:25
no guarantee either way you're saying that if i pick a low number then you might not serve me
19:31
if you pick a low number we're more likely our algorithm is more likely to say this is worth picking up for free
19:37
basically and so but there's no guarantee there's plenty of stuff that we rejected zero
19:42
percent because what the person wants is it's trash and they just want to get it removed and we're not going to do that
19:47
what are the advantages of letting the customer pick um well we're still playing around with
19:52
it we've changed the model quite a bit over the years and we're still playing around with this um
19:58
the advantage that we see is that people just feel more empowered they just know what the deal is
20:03
they know that it's in our best interest to sell for the highest price possible because we at the end of the day take a
20:09
big chunk of that as well but you know our hypothesis is that the main need for the
20:15
seller is really the removal they want to get that they need to move on friday they want us to show up provide the you
20:21
know the great service that our team provides and get that thing out their apartments uh on the date that they need it and
20:27
they're willing to basically pay up for that ishaan how does your pricing work
20:33
um so when we started our marketplace we charge as much as we can we basically wanted to make sure that
20:39
there was the need for our service and that people were willing to pay i didn't want to start from the lowest
20:46
pay possible and then find it really hard to to make a margin later on so we were
20:51
starting at like 30 margins um and everybody was going to be clear taking
20:57
30 of the fee that the service provider we're taking 30 of what the client paid
21:04
so one thing we knew was that all of our competitors were doing nickel and diming right we call it a a pay-to-place system so you want to
21:11
talk to a provider you got to be a member oh you want to do a backer check then there's an extra dollar on this right so
21:16
we just said everything's included you're not gonna have to figure out how much you're gonna pay like whatever you see as the per
21:22
hour rate you can figure out very quickly any four hours at twenty-five dollars that's a hundred you know a hundred dollars right i'm done
21:28
um people like that so much better than trying to figure out how much they have to add up so that was when we made tri uh price
21:35
really transparent when we first started just for simple accounting we had everybody at the same
21:40
rate and it was really hard to find a diverse group of supply because everybody had
21:45
different levels of experience so as we were able to prove out our business our cto built out
21:51
our platform that allowed individual suppliers to come in at their own pay rate and we were
21:57
able to give them some pricing guidelines like oh you only have two years of experience so this is the good range for you
22:04
whereas if you have 30 years of night nurse experience you're on the top range and it gives clients a choice i mean
22:10
that's such a great point because uh part of the service that all of you are providing is well except maybe east
22:15
meets east is like uh guidance on pricing helping these people sell something and they probably
22:21
have no experience ever doing that so jayden how do you work with your suppliers do you give them guidance on
22:27
pricing is is that kind of a service lower case or capital case yeah
22:33
so the list price that they they put their items on pietra
22:38
at we give them guidance we tell them kind of what we're seeing selling what the aovs are on pietra
22:44
um but they choose right they set whatever the price are as far as margin goes on our side we
22:50
have a pretty clear pattern matching that we can do to the retail industry
22:55
right so like the core of our marketplace is this ready-to-wear side of things which is like you can
23:00
list 500 items you can list thousands of items and we sell those every day so in retail
23:06
right now retailers are taking about 50 of the uh margin from all of these brands and
23:13
so we came in and said we're going to be at least half of that and so we have a pretty clear story for
23:18
them to come on pietro and sell through us and you help them set the prices for sorry just going back to the yeah you do okay
23:25
yeah so we don't help them set the prices but we provide guidance on best practices for it for the marketplace
23:31
kenji how does pricing work for customers of east meets east so in our case it's a little different
23:38
we started charging quite early because what happened was the female members we have
23:43
more male members than the female members in the heterosexual section so what happened what are the
23:49
percentages if you don't mind it's about uh 30 to 40 versus 60 to 70
23:54
so but male members are much more active as well so what happened was female
24:00
members were bombarded with messages so we realized that we had to do
24:06
something about it um yeah so that's why that's when we decided to charge quite a bit for mail members only
24:14
so that we can read out unwanted messages and it also weeded out uh filtered out
24:21
uh what is it uh people who are only looking for hookup because i don't think people are willing to pay for hookups they just
24:28
wanted freebies so uh it's it's true it's true he's just
24:34
talking about business people it's just metrics guys metrics kenji what did you charge so we
24:42
charge uh higher than you know normal dating apps because we uh cater to a specific need of a
24:48
community so we charge about uh if you wanted to go for like a one-year
24:53
plan then it's it comes out to be about 15 per month but if you only do one month
25:00
which we discourage because you're not gonna find a soulmate in one month it's about forty dollars yep yeah and
25:06
how much nudging does eastme east do to help people if you are encouraging
25:13
not hookups but forever love and partnership what are you doing to encourage that if
25:19
anything actually we don't really want to encourage forever like in one shot because we want them to come
25:26
back matrix matrix yeah yeah yeah so uh the the rate of success that's your
25:34
question uh my question was how do you get people
25:39
to be in long-term relationships and the answer is you do not no no no that was a joke
25:44
but um it's unlikely that people will meet his soul mate in one one shot so 40 of our customers come
25:52
back so we want our the experience to be as good as possible so they will come back because we don't
25:59
manipulate so that they don't get a success because you know it's just by nature it
26:05
doesn't work out but you're optimizing for retention and and being a long-term resource for them as they look for love
26:11
uh and how long is the average duration someone spends on east meets east
26:16
so uh it's about two uh two months two months yeah so that's
26:22
that's good but they come back so 40 of the users come back to become a
26:28
customer again got it talk to me about engagement metrics how do you
26:33
um how do you know that people are active on the platform how are you tracking people is it important to you
26:38
arun let's start with you on this do you need the same people coming back consistently are you constantly out
26:44
looking for new people yeah um so new versus existing um obviously in a marketplace you want
26:50
either side yeah you want you want both uh you need accuracy so you cut it by seller and buyer and you cut acquisition
26:55
and retention um so if you're retaining all your existing supply that's great um but like you need all four quadrants
27:03
if that picture is clear like buyer sellers acquisition and ltv need to be healthy um and based on where your marketplace
27:10
is you need to focus on different ones at different times um so i think that's super important it depends on what your business is
27:15
too in terms of like what kind of engagement you want from your users obviously in like a dating app you know
27:21
like um you want uh i mean or like furniture it depends on
27:26
the purchasing habits of your customer right so like if your customer is buying like a mattress right like you want them to they're only gonna buy a mattress
27:32
once every five or ten years right so you need to get uh you need to be heavier on acquisition than you are in retention for us you can buy clothes like once a
27:38
month or you know once a week or once a day depending on how intuitive you are um so it really just means you need some
27:44
match you need to match your expectations of your ltv to um your customers or your engagement
27:49
right so like and then it's about average order value versus repeat right so there's a lot of it's a big it's a big question ishwan how do
27:57
you cultivate retention and uh engagement on your platform from either side
28:03
yeah so i would first say that um as starting a marketplace we really struggled with finding the right metric
28:08
for us um you know you google marketplace metrics and then there's like a standard list but i think you really
28:15
have to really know your business to find the right ones we were finding so many laggard indicators
28:21
so at first we were like oh let's track revenue and then revenue will come and we're like oh great and they'll be like oh not
28:28
so great this month and we couldn't really push the revenue because we didn't see it until hindsight so
28:34
um late last year where actually middle of last year we made a decision to you know what like what really works for us
28:40
is sessions so just as a step back we offer cooking cleaning night nurse child care
28:46
all the way through elder care so they're all in different price points so having a really clean metric like
28:51
looking at number of sessions and growing that month over month gave us the clarity on what we
28:56
need to push for it just made a cleaning session that was at a hundred dollars the same value as a night nurse
29:03
that was at 320 dollars so that just balanced everything out for us um and when you say
29:09
sorry if i misunderstand about you when you're pushing sessions you're uh saying you're putting this in front
29:14
of people i'm sorry how are you like so i think when we were looking at sessions we were able to say oh you know
29:20
what we're going ourselves on getting 100 sessions this month you know we have 80 in the books right how we're going to
29:26
get the other 20 and then we get to think okay who are the type of people we need to go after these are are they reoccurring you know
29:33
they're people who are needing babysitting month you know week over week are they one-offs
29:38
um it just made it a little easier for us to strategize on how to push that number ahead a month over month to achieve our goals
29:45
but in terms of engagement and retention um we're still trying to figure that out a little bit to be honest with you
29:51
we noticed that people come and use us for three months and then drop off and we're like oh maybe they don't like us
29:57
but then two months later they're back you know and this is kind of proving our thesis is that people need care through different
30:03
phases in their lives and it's not very neat yep right so you can't say oh because i lost them in one month
30:09
it doesn't mean that they're never coming back so we're still trying to figure out what that retention like for us it was starting at one month
30:14
and then we saw people come back three months we're like okay and then we saw people come back on nine months so we're still trying to figure out the
30:20
right and how do you mitigate people going outside the platform to get the services from the same people
30:26
yeah so uh carrots and sticks you should always be thinking about that we have a very heavy penalty for
30:32
clients who poach our providers we when you book our sessions we literally
30:37
say in our terms that we have the right to charge you 4 500 um that is what you would pay an agency
30:43
so it's not absurd if you were to hire an agency to help you find these people that's what they would charge you have you done that
30:49
we actually had one client come to us and say i love your provider so much i'm going to take her off your platform
30:55
and pay us 4 500 okay and then she tried to and it was such a nightmare she asked for a refund and then came back onto our platform
31:02
so i think the value add that we provided for our clients when they realize wow if i had to do this on my
31:07
own it it sucks um and it's totally worth the margin that you are charging me to do this
31:12
um so that's what jayden what are your key metrics yeah so i think that i love the quadrant
31:18
that was a great imaginary quadrant um for us it is about buyers and sellers but it's also about
31:24
um we have a low uh frequency marketplace right it's jewelry so it's not like you're you're buying something every day someone spends four thousand
31:30
dollars in one day it's not like they're coming back tomorrow and if we don't see them we're not really mad about it so we do look at gmv obviously we look
31:37
at traffic we look at most importantly for us i think is if we look at
31:42
do people love us do people say that they love the experience on both sides and that's something that's really important for us as a marketplace
31:49
it's a little tough to quantify sometimes but you see it when designers keep logging into the portal
31:55
you see it when they post on their community feed you see it when customers start responding and commenting to those
32:00
designers posting so we've built this kind of community for them and if they're engaged with it we can see that not in sales but in
32:07
in activity i'll pay what are your key metrics hi kaio
32:12
yeah we're similar in the sense that it's a lower frequency purchase and sale at the end of the day um so we
32:19
tend to there are a lot of metrics that we look at on a daily basis on my dashboard there are dozens of them but the most
32:26
important things for us are the aov and the unit cost of everything that goes aov average order value and then all the
32:34
different um the average cost of doing everything that we do in the business when we're doing the pickups and the
32:40
deliveries and everything in between and then looking at what our gross margin is and then looking at what the
32:46
all-in cpa for an order is one thing that we did find really challenging and some of
32:51
you might be running into that as well is that it was really difficult for us to
32:56
actually split the spend into the two quadrants because we'd put an ad out there to get people to buy the
33:02
furniture and then people would come in and sell and the opposite would happen when we were putting out um you know when we were spending on
33:08
getting sellers on the site so the way that we deal with it
33:14
is you know we look at our all in paid cpa and our all-in effective cpa as well just as a gut
33:20
check and ultimately if your paid cpa is meaningfully lower than you know
33:26
the average you know net you know that margin you have on an order in a good place you can you know with every order you can you know
33:31
kind of spin that flywheel faster and faster and just abbreviations that have come up cost per acquisition cpa and also ltv came up
33:38
before in case anyone doesn't know that's lifetime value uh let's um stay with
33:44
kyo for a minute and i do want to hear from almost everyone on this oh everyone uh what is your marketing mix
33:50
right now what's working for you in terms of channels yes um i it's there's a good chunk of
33:59
it it's different the breakdown is different for both sides but on the acquisition side it's a good
34:04
mix of craigslist sem social media and other test channels
34:10
that we had on top of it do you have a dedicated marketing team or is it still the founders running
34:15
marketing no we do have a head of marketing who's managing multiple outsourced one agency and multiple
34:21
outsourced employees as well are you finding that one team or one person can manage both sides of the
34:27
marketplace or do you generally keep them separate at the moment it's one person managing
34:33
multiple teams that manage the multiple size of the marketplace but i imagine the agency that we use probably handles
34:38
both sides of the of the marketplace kenji what about yusmi's what does your
34:43
marketing mix look like we have about 50 percent in digital marketing including facebook adwords uh
34:50
snapchat and all these uh platforms and uh we are very big on influencer marketing so for
34:56
for example we collaborate a lot with youtubers we do instagram stories uh at least three a
35:02
month and what's what worked for us is that uh you know some people might believe that you know
35:08
uh if your product or services is good then it's gonna naturally go viral right but uh you know
35:14
you got to be careful with that because nowadays people look for fun content you know
35:20
they just don't want to look at the services they want to look at you know buzzfeed style article or like
35:25
a video so what we do is that we use those contents that we make with influencers release it on
35:33
their channel first and we have the right to use it and boost it on our you know digital media
35:41
platform so we just use it as a facebook ads and the click rate is like you know hundred
35:46
times more than if you just did it or esme's web you know asian dating app you know
35:52
it's boring you know yeah yeah and each one what about you what is your marketing look like right now uh we do primarily
35:59
a lot of digital advertising we test into different channels uh we started content marketing which
36:04
was good for us as well and we're now launching content marketing to both sides of actually we don't do anything for
36:10
providers we put out a free ad and we get 250 applications coming in without any
36:16
spend okay um so all of our marketing is for the consumers and we are testing into partnerships
36:22
this year arun how about you yeah uh so we're a little bit of a weird case
36:27
um we actually haven't didn't spend any money on marketing until about six months ago um and we built the business uh mostly
36:34
on organic we did a lot of partnerships in the beginning i guess we focus a lot on our
36:40
brand uh which i think is atypical for most companies that are starting out because we back in 2014 when we launched
36:48
um it was like kind of weird to buy used clothes so people are like oh like you want to buy this shirt for
36:53
me if you're like that's gross like why would i want to buy your shirt so we focused a lot on like brand building and like changing the narrative
36:58
from buying used clothes to just buying nice clothes like either rare clothes or expensive clothes or clothes that asap
37:04
rocky wore um so that was like really a big part of like what we did in the beginning to build our brand
37:09
um and that had a great run-on effect from uh organic traffic um and our granite
37:14
acquisition so that was most of what we did until about like six months ago obviously seo is really big for us
37:20
any marketplace that inherently has a really large catalog um should invest a lot of money in seo or
37:25
early um as i'm sure kaio does as well um and i actually just want to go back
37:31
to brand because that's not something we hear well that's a big question that comes up
37:36
how much did you invest in brand and how did you make that decision to say this is a worthwhile investment and you know is was it under 50k was it
37:44
over what money yeah for investing in brand oh um it's not just about the money right it's
37:49
like mostly about other things like the visual design of the website like the partners that you choose to work with um the curation of the items on your
37:55
website right so like back when we first started i would delete items from the website like constantly and it was just like i don't know it's
38:01
very specific right i was like this is something that i would ever wear so i'm going to delete this and like the website in the early days was basically like a reflection of things that i
38:07
thought were cool um so that was kind of like the curation basically and then as we scale from there i'm like well you know
38:12
preppy style is cool too you know so like we should uh allow those items onto the marketplace we've kind of like brought in from there
38:18
um so it's hard to quantify it in terms of like a dollar investment one thing we have done is like projects
38:23
that we do that really um kind of like demonstrate our brand and sort of like demonstrate our ethos like out onto the marketplace so i mentioned
38:29
earlier um when we started charging we did this like flash sale promotion so what we did is so our website or our
38:35
app is called grailed we launched this thing called the grailed 100 and basically we did is we spent i think
38:40
like 100k buying items from like the last 30 years of men's clothing and men's fashion
38:46
like old dior and like salaran and like gucci like stuff from like japan that was only available for like three years
38:51
and we like brought 100 items into the to the company or to our office and we did a big photo shoot like styled
38:57
them we styled like maybe eight or ten looks and we did this like really big editorial photo shoot i think we spent another maybe 20 grand on the imagery
39:03
and we hired this like really great photography and we merchandised this like really beautiful sale page for 100 items which
39:08
is kind of ridiculous but at the time we were like fairly small um uh so we put together the sale page with
39:14
like all this imagery of these items and these people and it was like looks that nobody in the men's fashion space had ever seen before
39:20
right because it's stuff that you have from 20 years ago and stuff that you have from 10 years ago and stuff you have from right now so like no retailer would ever do a mix like
39:26
that because nobody's ever selling items that are that old so like the styling and like the juxtaposition of these items was like
39:32
very different um and the curation like spoke to a lot of people right it's like they were like wow these are like the hundred best
39:37
items that these are the items that grail things are 100 best i also think these items are great so grilled gets me you know like grill this
39:42
is a place that i belong because these people like really understand fashion the way that i understand fashion so when we launched that sale and we
39:48
sold everything for like half we paid for like that 100 grand turned into 50 grand once we sold it um but it was an amazing marketing tool
39:54
an amazing brand building tool we were like hey look this is what we believe you know like this is what is true to us and like we're
40:00
authentic consumers and like enthusiasts like of this space who is running marketing now i grilled
40:06
um uh a more professional team and are they running marketing for both sides yeah um so we
40:14
don't actually focus on seller marketing uh enough um mostly because you remember the
40:20
quadrant um our seller ltvs are very healthy um we our seller at vs go up over time which is amazing like
40:26
ltvs never go up over time um or it's very rare um so we don't have to focus on that as much and our cell acquisition is like
40:33
okay i mean it could be better obviously but since that side of the marketplace is relatively healthy like that's not the areas of the
40:39
business in which we focus jaden how do you you when you described starting out you went very one-on-one
40:46
to get the suppliers to the platform so what is the process now how do you market to them
40:51
yes so we did start out i'd think of the supply side almost like b2b sales and then the demand side is is kind of a
40:57
traditional e-commerce business so just quickly on the the demand side i think it's important that we look at
41:04
like you know a market channel fit and whether our company makes sense in the different channels so we look at google
41:10
search we look at shopping we look at facebook ads we look at organic we look at email we look at seo
41:15
and what we found was we had to understand the journey that our customer would take
41:20
so like in the beginning i remember we were sitting there like oh facebook is not converting well for us let's get out of facebook entirely and
41:26
like that's obviously wrong so what we had to figure out was facebook is this is the first conversion then we
41:33
have to get them in our client file then they have to have a good experience during their first three browses we have to learn a little bit about who
41:39
they are then we have to recommend them the right product in email and then maybe they'll come back and purchase something so all that has to be
41:46
in place to kind of get your marketing down on the demand side on the supply side it's it's
41:51
it's a little different right we're not running ads to to suppliers um it's hard to kind of find them and
41:56
and market to them effectively but we know if they go to some convention or we kind of know who they are in the world
42:02
because they've identified themselves as like i like jewelry i am a jeweler i design things and so we reach out to them and
42:08
we have a funnel where it's like start with an email maybe you get into the phone call they come visit the site is the landing page
42:14
working do they go through to the designer portal because we have you can get through to our designer portal and just see what's going on in there
42:20
you can't be live but you can you can go in you can add some items you can put your profile up and then we can tell you if if you're a
42:27
good fit for pietra and so that's sort of the funnel for for those people
42:32
i want to stay with you on that note and i want to hear a little bit about product and how that evolved so
42:38
when you were doing your first 15 to go back to that number was it manual you mean finding those suppliers or
42:45
sorry operating the custom work and matching the
42:50
yeah so the way that we started out and and we're kind of on our fourth product in our stack right now
42:56
so the early product was a um essentially an open marketplace for diamond jewelry or
43:02
for custom projects so you'd come in and you would essentially make a request and it would go out to 60 people
43:09
something like that some some subset of the marketplace where like that was the proper people
43:14
they were diamond people they were designers something like that and what happens was
43:19
you'd have 20 bids coming back and people wouldn't know what to do with it so we started kind of curating a bit
43:26
more and deciding all right we're going to not send every message back to the customer we're going to stop it and put a comparison sheet together
43:33
for that customer and suddenly that was a much better approach for us so the product evolved over time so it just seems like i mean i feel like
43:41
there's a manual start to a lot of these stories um and it sounds like it's
43:46
almost necessary um so can you speak to in kenji i'd love to hear about you
43:53
how did you you know was yours yours probably was not a manual start i take that back
43:59
what did your first version of a product look like so it was more like a age group which is very important city
44:06
geography and um there is um uh active you know how last login so basically we
44:13
don't want to show people who are not what were they logging into uh to the app uh their website
44:18
and so when you launched and you had your first target market new york city
44:24
uh heterosexuals from asia what was
44:29
the pro did you build the product first or did was there any like mvp of the product that you tested
44:36
out and uh you know to learn so basically we just launched it but it
44:43
was called beta but it's still a you know uh not an mvp so it's a full-fledged product but it's
44:49
on a web base now we have apps and what happened was that we we didn't have a sophisticated algorithm
44:56
to display the profiles so we just showed someone who were most active
45:02
within that age group and geography so you know these female would likely respond to
45:09
the males who messed up and did you have a cto at the time or yes we did and did they custom build
45:14
this yes yes we had to do that okay yeah and at what point did you decide to start
45:20
honing the algorithm uh i think uh like a year later
45:26
because i think people tend to give a chance so it didn't really matter
45:32
initially because we didn't have too many people to zero in on uh at that point it was still okay as
45:38
long as the member is active one in ten messages will get responded too sure but the more you have people you
45:46
know you have to develop an algorithm to match the people more accurately yeah ishaan what was your version one of
45:53
the or what was your mvp it was a contact us form and it was literally people were
45:58
sending us an email and we were right back we would had all our provider profiles in a pdf that we would
46:04
send to as an attachment they would open it up they would say i would like this person we would do everything through
46:10
google calendars and we got to a point where it got so ugly we were like okay i think we
46:15
need to build something so um we did raise friends and family to build a
46:21
mvp um with an outsourced company um and i would say for anybody looking to
46:26
build anything we try to build a very minimal lovable product we did not
46:32
we still over built so i would really just say you know really focus on building that mvp as small as tight as
46:38
possible but during that time we found our cto who's also our co-founder now he was the
46:44
co-founding um cto of coffee meets bagel so um i met him cold
46:49
so again you don't have to know these connections i met him through angel list he was building through matching
46:54
algorithms there and then was that roomy um and then when he heard what we were doing and the traction that we were
47:00
seeing he's like yeah you need this and you've already proven out the model so i'm all in
47:06
and then he started building on top of all of our new stuff jayden what was v1 of your product you said you were on the fourth product
47:12
and what is the product now yeah so just one funny anecdote about the first like
47:18
just some war stories i guess um the first sales on pietra like i was on
47:24
the phone with the customers like helping like i remember my first engaging ring sale like i got a
47:30
guy to spend nine thousand dollars who i'd never met before some guy in colorado and it was just
47:35
like a big day in the office but it was very manual at first eventually we figured it out um so the
47:41
product now is actually we still have engagement we still have custom we have ready to wear
47:46
now we're actually moving one step farther and we're helping creators start with an idea and take it
47:52
through to a product so that in design help sample help going all the way through to opening up
47:59
a pietra shop and selling their item to their friends family and communities i just with both jaden and each one it
48:05
just seems like it would be very tempting did you ever consider just saying like you know forget
48:11
a website like i can operate this marketplace through a sophist i mean you're talking about a high priced
48:17
product you're talking about a high value you know very sticky product i say that as a mom
48:22
who used had to use a babysitting service for tonight in an emergency and so um to just be able to call up
48:30
and say i need someone it's a pretty valuable thing so did you ever consider just saying like no i can you know
48:36
just charge a little bit more and and operate this as a service not a second yeah so what
48:42
we actually found was that the connection wasn't quite enough for the transaction
48:48
to occur and what could happen then is let's say we connected two people together suddenly we get into this game of like
48:55
trying to to police people from going off platform for us is a big deal because every transaction is like
49:00
it could be ten thousand dollars for one transaction so we started building tools for them so we
49:05
became more valuable so like a project management tool to help them kind of design together the ability to find other partners for
49:12
sourcing and packaging we opened up the marketplace so it's a bit more layered now and that's not something they can do
49:18
without us yeah apol what what about you you had craigslist at what point
49:24
you know in google ads at what point did the website yeah our product service and marketing
49:30
evolved multiple times um iterated multiple times over the years um the initial the very
49:37
initial product was uh the very basic website that i paid some developers in ukraine to put
49:43
together the the launch was extremely manual i spent about a month or so i'm just buying
49:50
furniture on craigslist with very little capital invested into it we had about 100 items or so to
49:55
launch the website the product was on the on the sell side our offer was
50:00
has always been actually the same thing because our hypothesis was this is a big waste problem
50:06
how can we solve this problem and envision a solution that's uh that can be the 21st century solution
50:12
if you will and for that the most important thing was giving the sellers the fast free pickup
50:18
and we still do that we offer the exact same thing to the sellers but on the buy side in the first product what we
50:23
offered was a rental actually and the idea our initial name is furniture the idea was that we would
50:28
pick up for free and then we're going to rent this out to people and we're going to make money together and we'll pay you on a monthly basis basically
50:36
that was a very novel idea this was kind of early for its time now there are more rental companies
50:41
startups these days but it was very hard to explain to people the pricing was kind of it didn't make sense to
50:48
people the sellers want to do more so we iterated to uh furniture
50:53
subscription business so the south side was exactly the same the buy side was easier to explain to people who
51:00
were subscribing and we moved to website to woocommerce of all places to wordpress
51:05
and we actually ran on that for quite a bit of time um and we realized that it was we got a
51:11
lot more traction we realized people really uh understood and the buyers were loving sellers always loved the service but
51:17
buyers also started loving the service war but it wasn't the you know the 21st century
51:23
breakthrough that we were hoping to become but one thing uh we did notice was that people were
51:29
calling us and saying i really love this thing i just want to buy it can i pay you more money and buy this thing off you
51:34
and if you're serious about building a consumer business you should listen when your customer tells you i want to
51:40
pay you more money take my money so that's what we did and we using the
51:45
same woocommerce platform i stayed up for about three weeks working with developers in
51:51
india tweak the website so that we could sell products on the website now this was
51:56
by this time a complete frankenstein of a website i mean i wouldn't have touched that
52:01
website with a 10 foot pole it took about 30 seconds to load a page i've had people in checkout who failed
52:08
because we were a new business you know trying to buy a 200 west town sofa
52:14
and i get notifications every time and i'd call them up and say hey if you give me your credit card over the
52:19
phone i can push this through and i'll tell you i've done that probably about three
52:24
dozen times the number of times people said no were zero even though checkout was taking about 30
52:31
seconds to load you could switch between different fields in checkout and because there were multiple plugins that didn't
52:36
communicate with each other you would lose some of your entry that made me realize like this is some
52:41
this there's value here and if people are willing to put up with this we probably don't need to prioritize fixing this
52:48
right now we should probably prioritize building the infrastructure that's going to run the whole thing and because of that
52:54
the latest iteration of the product only happened about two years ago or so on the marketing pivot to actually
52:59
spending money on advertising really happened in the last 13 14 months or so we spent the whole
53:05
time building the infrastructure building the erp backend that's going to really power you know what we were doing
53:11
and in the last year or so we've really began you know advertising more aggressively you've probably started seeing the trucks if
53:18
some of you know the brand from before a lot more often because that's when we started to you know really invest in you
53:24
know getting the word out let's hear from everyone what is your number one piece of advice to entrepreneurs building
53:30
a marketplace startup each one um i would go back to my point on
53:36
building mvp really thinking about building the smallest mvp you can to test out what you need to without over building
53:43
great kenji i would say that uh you pay attention to the needs of the customers
53:50
and if there is such needs really because if there's none you you gotta listen to the customers yep
53:57
thank you so i think i'll talk about failure a
54:03
little bit um so i think early on it's easy to think that
54:08
when something doesn't work it's a failure and it is but i think psychologically it's important
54:14
to to understand that every day the failure is in not knowing the answer to something it's not an
54:19
actually failing and so if you're failing every day which means you don't know an answer
54:25
it starts to get psychologically debilitating so like set your expectations to a point where
54:31
if i ask a question and i get an answer on tuesday that was a good day and i think that's that's something that
54:37
is is uh important to internalize uh and then one marketplace one is uh
54:42
if you hear from both sides at the same time that it's awesome that's your product because we did a lot
54:48
of things where one side was like this is amazing and the other side was like you're you're draining us this is tough
54:53
great iron uh yeah so so marketplaces uh specifically i think that
54:59
marketplaces right now mean a lot of different things um i think the definition is very trendy or the term is very trendy and i think
55:05
the definition is very broad i would say that as you're building your marketplace i would really be careful about balancing doing things
55:11
that don't scale versus things that do scale um so there's like the famous story of airbnb like in the beginning they sent
55:16
photographers to everybody's house to take great photos of everything but obviously you can't do that at scale it doesn't work
55:21
though i think maybe they are doing that at scale now i'm not sure um any but anyway um so i i'll be careful
55:27
to not set up your marketplace in such a way that it stops you from scaling right because like if you're like oh i need to um you know go to everybody's
55:34
house in order to uh talk to them in order to do something right in order to get anything on my in
55:39
order to get supply on my marketplace then how many houses can you go to you know like it just makes it more difficult right so like in the beginning
55:45
there's definitely things that you need to do in order to jumpstart like manual stuff like we were all talking about like i reach out to people manually
55:50
you know craigslist like all like talk calling up suppliers directly and all that stuff is super important but make sure that as you're sort of
55:56
like setting that self up there is a point in time in which you can switch over to things that scale without your your manual involvement or you can set
56:02
it up in such a way that it does i like that kind of subtle keep it simple lesson there i'll pay yeah i think mine kind of goes
56:09
for any startup whatsoever not necessarily marketplace but it certainly helped us at kyo which is uh listen a lot and
56:17
iterate a lot as well we didn't start out as a marketplace it just happened to be that the solution to what
56:24
we were trying to solve was the marketplace so it's really important i think to
56:30
put something out there quickly make it as lean as possible if you can you know figure out if you
56:36
can launch something and get real information without really spending anything on marketing at all
56:41
if you can or very little on marketing do the biggest mvp you can listen uh intently with intent
56:49
and iterate you know if it doesn't work but you know you learn something that this
56:54
really works we should move in this direction and that doesn't work we need to get rid of that
56:59
you know be willing to really switch things and move quickly great so matt if i can just add
57:04
i mean just to bring it back to where we started this conversation marketplaces are really tough so i would
57:10
say if you want to build a marketplace you really have to have a passion for solving the problem that your marketplace is solving
57:16
because you will have a lot of challenges getting both sides going and that's the only motivation that kind
57:21
of keeps you going to make sure that your marketplace will succeed thank you sir if i could add to that too i think marketplaces are really tough um
57:28
but i think the main way and that they're really the main way that i found that they're really tough is that they take a really long time
57:33
you know so like it's hard to build continual supply and demand over time but you know if you keep edit and you go for like
57:39
years you know like you can have like a really solid business like we've seen and you know like a lot of marketplaces have
57:45
seen that like you know once you sort of get that scale it's like really hard to go down the marketplace are some of the most resilient businesses out there
57:51
which is amazing if it is an actual like real marketplace so it is really really really tough to get it going because it takes forever
57:57
um and as when i was like yeah so when you get partners on board like when i was talking to investors and stuff you know it was like it's important to get
58:02
an investor or like a partner that understands that that it is hard and it does take a long time but once you get it going it's like
58:08
you know it's really something special what are your top three growth hacking methods that not everyone is doing so
58:13
i'd love to hear from three individuals on a growth hacking method um ishawn let's start with you and i'd
58:19
also love to hear from arun and i paul growth hacking for us is
58:25
being able to offer a more diverse set of services than our competitors because it sets us apart
58:31
and it's able to have us go into conversations where our competitors can't so being able to offer our services as a
58:38
corporate benefit because it can be given to any employee regardless if they are a parent or not is more appealing than if you are a
58:45
bright horizon that's only offering child care or elder care mm-hmm everyone um yeah
58:51
interesting question i think um like i think growth hacking is like maybe something where like you can get
58:57
asymmetric value out of something that like not everybody else is i'm not sure like i don't know if we've
59:02
done anything that was like a growth hack necessarily i mean branding stuff has like paid like really real dividends
59:08
i think the uh audience the upvoters are kind of looking for things that they might not be thinking
59:14
of uh conventional marketing marketing tactics that people don't usually think of maybe reddit do people think about
59:21
reddit usually that's great reddit is a good one you know like you have a captive audience that is like very interest focused
59:26
right so like slash r anything that is relevant to your business but you have to be like really authentic otherwise they'll tear you apart so it's
59:33
it's tough you'll get banned pretty fast i've been banned from several forms
59:39
but yeah i think i think reddit is probably a good one like uh communities online communities are a good one um so which is hard but you know once you can
59:45
penetrate an online community you can really grow really quickly hi paul yeah um i don't know if people are thinking about this or not but two
59:52
things that worked really well for us and we still utilize one of them is one hiring people offshore to
59:59
just do some very menial tasks um people in you know bangladesh we have an
1:00:06
army of people in bangladesh that had an army of people at bangladesh at some point that just emailed people and told them hey
1:00:13
you know we exist and you can use the service and it's really nice you pay three dollars an hour but it's one text really that needs to
1:00:20
get out there and if you iterate on that text it works like a charm and you get incredible conversion for really no
1:00:26
money spent um the second thing that i think works really well if you can do it is
1:00:31
um writing scripts that can you know market your product on you know the couple of channels that you determine that work really well for you
1:00:38
we still have i still have a laptop actually that runs on my desk at work that um that has a script
1:00:46
it's so hacky and horrible to look at for a developer but it works like a
1:00:53
charm it pulls the products it posts and prioritizes them and posts them on several forums and websites where we
1:00:59
know buyers are looking at and you know it's still really positive
1:01:04
the audience wants to know about your tech stacks and i think we heard a bit about ipals jayden can we hear about what's running
1:01:11
the platform right now yes so uh i'm lucky to have some amazing amazing amazing product and
1:01:18
managers and engineers so rowan full time full time yeah so rowan pan built uberpool so it's it's i probably
1:01:26
couldn't ask for a better team um so we have a full-time web engineer
1:01:32
from google we have a team that does our back end pano is our cto he oversees all of that um so
1:01:39
we built the whole thing ourselves and we use we use some help from like stripe for payment processing
1:01:44
does everybody use stripe right yes arun i'll use paypal okay why do you
1:01:51
choose that over stripe um because we have to do claims arbitration um because sometimes people don't like
1:01:57
what they got uh and paypal handles all claim arbitration and i don't think there's another product out there that does that okay what about apiary we use stripe and
1:02:05
we also have square for gift cards are your is your stack internal do yeah is it built by
1:02:11
full-time yep so our cto who um adam does all the tech build and we use um
1:02:18
i'm trying to think we also have a ux designer and also a front-end designer what
1:02:24
are there any tools that are particularly useful for marketplaces or is it just payment any fancy algorithm tools we need to
1:02:31
know about no nothing fancy okay it depends on how you're building it
1:02:37
right like if you're building it off of like uh like wordpress or something then it's like easier if you're building a custom then like
1:02:43
i don't know there's tons of open source software that you can steal yeah or borrow or license well i guess i think i paul was
1:02:48
saying that he has his own fancy scripts running so there's that
1:02:54
the next question it's not fancy at all it's excel vba
1:02:59
for the product marketplaces how are they handling shipping costs uh who pays for a return so good operations question here um
1:03:08
a roon or ipod yeah any of you guys yeah um we charge buyers
1:03:15
the sellers get a free service at the moment there's nothing that you need to pay but the buyers do have to charge they do
1:03:22
have to pay for delivery depending on their cart value so you can get free delivery over a thousand dollars but
1:03:27
if you you know if you want something for less there's a little recharge attached to it
1:03:33
and uh the return policies uh for us the return policy is we treated like
1:03:38
a second-hand furniture sale that would happen outside of the service as well so if you're receiving something
1:03:44
inspect it make sure you're happy with it if you don't like it you can reject for any reason there's a small fee on it forty dollars for the
1:03:51
convenience of um you know bringing it to you we're gonna have to bring it back take care of it
1:03:57
if there was a fault on our end we always make sure to make the customer happy as well we don't nickel and dime people and that's why we
1:04:04
do well by customers we also offer local pickup from our storage facility in northberg and if you
1:04:10
go there the restocking fee is twenty dollars if you don't if you feel like it's not the thing that you really wanted to buy
1:04:16
are we what about you yeah so shipping is a huge pain um people don't want to get out of their house to the post office and mail things
1:04:22
so it's really hard to get them to do it we are pure seller to buyer like ebay so the seller will just mail the thing
1:04:28
directly to the buyer and then shipping is also interesting in the purchase price so i'm sure all of you like buy things online you're like
1:04:33
oh this is 100 bucks and you get to check out and you're like 30 shipping screw this but if it was like 130 with zero dollar shipping you'd be
1:04:38
like this is the greatest deal ever um and i think etsy famously tried to push all their sellers into
1:04:44
free shipping and they had like this like backlash like messaging is really really hard um and now they're like trying it again
1:04:50
i think it's working really well this time but buyers just want free shipping you know it's like just bake the shipping price and it's like that's that's what
1:04:55
everybody wants um and we actually don't take returns which i think is awesome but unclear how
1:05:00
it will scale unclear how that will scale yeah i mean like you know can you be a multi-billion
1:05:06
dollar business and not take returns uh maybe maybe not we push people to re-list right so if you get something
1:05:11
and it's like doesn't fit or it's not what you wanted just like we have like a one-click like repost and then everybody who's following the original item like
1:05:17
gets notified like hey it's back don't miss out again so usually stuff will sell sometimes it sells for more than it did the first
1:05:23
time um so that works pretty well but like again like i don't know like because like we as you get more and more customers
1:05:30
that are are less passionate and more mainstream maybe we won't be able to get them to
1:05:35
purchase unless they we offer uh returns i don't know but it's working well so far is it jayden
1:05:42
yeah so uh because we're in the sort of high-end space people expect free shipping um so we
1:05:48
cover the cost of shipping and also it helped us engender some trust with our customer base
1:05:53
so if they come and they see that we're handling it and they you know they meet some designer from australia they don't know who it is but
1:05:59
they know that pietro kind of has their back that has helped and then almost the opposite of you in returns
1:06:06
uh it was something that a lot of designers don't accept and by adding that to to the services we
1:06:12
provide we were able to kind of get customers to trust us sometimes well again we'll see how that's getting product though uh so
1:06:18
engage engravings and stuff you can't return but anything that's uh made to order you can return which is
1:06:23
the the big difference so anything that used to be made to order which is like four weeks used to be no returns and we added a return layer
1:06:30
and uh have you seen a lot of returns or what uh way less than a lot of e-commerce
1:06:36
companies we would match to so like look at revolve right if you look at their their uh offering it's like 800 million in sales and 400 million in
1:06:43
returns yeah the next question is about something you just brought up which is
1:06:48
trust um and i think this actually applies to each of you in very different ways how do you manage trust between the parties
1:06:54
involved and i think this is you know a question about authentication it's a question in some cases about
1:06:59
curation and it's even a question of you know being able to uh well i mean i think actually
1:07:05
kenji kind of an unusual case for this but there has to be trust that people are you know meeting the right people and
1:07:11
meeting people they you know the basic is like we have to have a
1:07:16
robust system to monitor the users coming in especially scammers that scam money out
1:07:22
of female users so that happens a lot but in addition to that i think we need to pay more attention to the marketing
1:07:28
because marketing determines what kind of users are coming into the platform and uh
1:07:35
we we do targeting very carefully so it's it's hard for us to use platform that doesn't allow a very
1:07:43
targeted um approach to marketing and you know it makes a huge difference
1:07:48
yeah yeah ishwan we had trust on the same aspect as well one area is
1:07:55
providers come to us because we actually decrease all the scams um you guys i'm sure working on
1:08:01
craigslist too right it's like you know i have to have cleaning done today but i'm gonna pay you in advance
1:08:07
and cash can i pay you first on through a credit uh through a check i'm going to mail you we don't take any
1:08:12
of that we have a strict credit card policy so we just say i'm sorry you know we take a credit card and that usually reduces a
1:08:19
lot of scam providers love the fact that they don't get any of those scam calls anymore
1:08:24
so we weed them out for them so that's why they like to be on our platform but from the client side we actually vet
1:08:30
all of our providers so everyone is background checked sex offenders list checked against as
1:08:37
well as three to five uh professional references that we have spoke to before they're able to join the
1:08:42
platform so we're a gated platform and that has really given the clients a lot of trust
1:08:48
um initially it's really interesting when they first come on they still want to talk to the provider want to get a sense of who they are and
1:08:53
then by their second and third provider they're like just send your set provider she looks great i don't want to talk to her no don't
1:08:59
need to talk to her um so what we're really starting to see is that as a branded platform we're able to shift the
1:09:06
trust away from having to build from the individual provider but that the customers are putting their trust in apiary
1:09:13
i paul um devil's advocate question here you don't you probably don't have many
1:09:18
buyers returning very frequently and so what is the incentive to i mean i
1:09:24
know you're trying to deliver a good product but you know what is the incentive to
1:09:29
fostering that relationship over you know all the myriad things that you have to invest in
1:09:34
as a growing company so it's it's a few things um
1:09:40
on in terms of trust buyer buy side is the biggest trust seeking side of the market for us
1:09:46
or has problems with other places because if you look at a peer-to-peer furniture marketplace
1:09:51
they're very clear conflicts of interest between the buyers and sellers the sellers want to get something out
1:09:57
quickly for as much money as they can and they don't have the biggest incentive to be honest about
1:10:03
the condition of the piece and the buyers are trying to find real value out there basically and what we provided
1:10:10
that really worked for us since the early days is really good quality photography that really you know depicting the
1:10:16
current condition of this thing so that when you receive it you're not surprised by um you know well
1:10:22
the side of the thing looks great but you've got you know five holes on the other side of the sofa so removing that surprise element
1:10:31
was really helpful for us and the second thing is things will still go wrong there will be cases where you might overlook something
1:10:38
or for no fault of the customer yours a transaction might turn bad providing
1:10:43
really great customer service is really important as well so if you can what we like to think about is you know
1:10:49
any scenario where there's a crisis it's really an opportunity to you know recruit an evangelist and if
1:10:55
you approach those problems like that you know and if you're you know very strict on your kpis and numbers
1:11:02
generally it doesn't actually cost that much money but if you can spin that experience to something really positive
1:11:08
you can actually really get somebody who's going to be marketing for you and that's what we've really spent a lot of time uh
1:11:14
doing as well and helped us you know build a lot of trust it makes people go out and talk about hey you know these guys
1:11:20
vetted the thing and you know i got what i wanted and one thing i didn't like and they you know fixed it for me they gave me a coupon so
1:11:26
i went back and bought something else it it goes a long way if you do good by
1:11:32
your customers another stat question marketing stack
1:11:37
what are your tools anyone can jump in um i use hootsuite
1:11:44
to do all of my social posts uh wordpress for our blog um and
1:11:50
canva is a great one just to design any type of graphical elements for any of anything that you need
1:11:56
kenji we use the same food suite canva and we use a lot of analytics too
1:12:02
uh amplitude we use apps flyer that's that's both for marketing and
1:12:08
retention analysis yep great uh yeah we're using some basic tools uh mailchimp
1:12:14
probably moving over to something called clavio um google analytics i live in there every
1:12:20
day i'm basically just looking at what's going on and then we get reports from we have someone who's helping us with digital
1:12:26
marketing so we have a dashboard that they provide to us and do you use a crm or customer success
1:12:31
so we are implementing a crm now arun um we use um we use braze
1:12:38
um for uh like retention marketing like push notifications and and stuff like that i think we use a
1:12:45
sendgrid or i think we also do use um uh i don't know there's another email provider as well
1:12:52
um there's like a bunch of seo tools that we use i think i'm not sure actually which ones they are i'm not i'm not the best person to
1:12:58
ask where i'm working especially so can i just did you use any key tools at the beginning
1:13:04
in the beginning um not not really i'm trying to think i don't think so
1:13:10
yeah really our blog or like our content marketing was like custom on our uh on our own website so
1:13:16
no like google analytics obviously but like everything like metrics tools are a little bit different i guess than uh than marketing stack i paul yeah we
1:13:23
use um a lot of the same tools we use hootsuite some wordpress for
1:13:28
blog posts we use clavio we use just2know for capturing people
1:13:33
people's emails we use analytics but we also have some custom built
1:13:40
dashboards on redash as well that we aggregate on great
1:13:46
well thank you to our speakers and let's give them a round of applause
1:14:01
you
