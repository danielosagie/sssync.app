how we made
0:03
$1,260 in 3 weeks of launching our SAS
0:07
this was written December 19th 2022 this
0:11
is going to be a great episode this is a
0:13
story of a SAS startup user Maven that
0:16
was able to generate more than
0:19
$120,000 in Revenue in just 3 weeks of
0:23
public launch without external
0:25
investment without paid ads and without
0:28
app Sumo this is is from wakar Aim on
0:32
Indie hackers.com super indepth
0:35
breakdown is really going to be good
0:38
here we go so the author says I am going
Overview of Usermaven's Journey
0:41
to cover everything we did during this
0:43
journey how we got the idea to build
0:46
this SAS how we got beta users and
0:48
validated the idea what channels we use
0:51
to drive visitors to our website why we
0:54
decided to do an LTD and how we did it
0:57
without appsumo the best practices of
1:00
running an LTD campaign traffic stats
1:03
Revenue figures and everything in
1:05
between is revealed LTD by the way is a
1:08
lifetime deal so they sold their sass
1:11
with a lifetime deal buckle up and get a
1:14
cup of coffee because it's going to be a
1:16
long and interesting read here we go the
The Birth of Usermaven
1:20
idea and how it all started it all
1:23
started about 18 months ago when my two
1:26
co-founders and I began working on user
1:28
Maven a no Cod code analytics and
1:31
attribution tool designed for Simplicity
1:33
and ease of use to be honest our
1:36
frustration with the difficulty of
1:38
setting up analytics for our other SAS
1:40
products doing seven figures in ARR in
1:43
annual recurring Revenue content studio
1:45
and replug was the main driving force
1:47
behind developing an Analytics tool so
1:49
they had problems with what they were
1:51
previously using they said we can build
1:53
something better we searched high and
1:55
low for an analytic solution that was
1:57
easy to use and didn't require degree in
2:00
computer science to set up but
2:02
unfortunately all of the options we
2:04
tried mix panel amplitude and others
2:06
fell short they were overly complex hard
2:09
to configure and a huge time sync for
2:12
our team every time we made a change to
2:14
our website or product we had to ask
2:17
developers product managers and
2:18
marketers to reconfigure event tracking
2:21
and Reporting this was timec consuming
2:23
and often got put on the back burner so
2:25
we never got the meaningful insights we
2:27
were looking for that's why we decided
Building the Initial Product
2:30
to build a simple solution to this
2:32
problem the basic tool we built inhouse
2:34
provided insights in just a few clicks
2:37
and as we continue to add new features
2:39
to the requests of our product team user
2:41
Maven gradually became our go-to
2:44
solution for driving business growth and
2:46
product success we were able to answer a
2:48
lot of questions such as which traffic
2:51
sources or campaigns are bringing in the
2:53
most customers how many people signed up
2:56
last week and how many completed
2:57
onboarding how many of those onboarded
3:00
users reach the activation activation
3:02
stage which feature in the product is
3:04
being loved the most and which is
3:06
causing user fatigue who are the power
3:08
users of a specific feature SL module
3:11
who are the slipping away users we can
3:13
interact with to reduce turn and much
Challenges with Existing Tools
3:16
more now comes the real struggle getting
3:19
beta users validation and pre-launch
3:22
when a product is used internally rather
3:25
than by actual users The Experience can
3:27
differ because internal users may have
3:30
varying levels of expertise and
3:32
perspectives on the product internal
3:34
team members May understand the
3:36
product's features and limitations
3:38
better and they may be more forgiving of
3:40
any bugs or issues real users on the
3:44
other hand may not be as familiar with
3:46
the product and may be less patient with
3:49
any problems they encounter as a result
3:51
the feedback and usage patterns of real
3:54
users may be more representative of the
3:56
broader Market providing us with
3:59
valuable insight into how the product
4:01
will perform once it's officially
4:04
released so we started different
4:06
initiatives to get the word out as early
4:08
as possible to find beta users and
4:11
validate the idea step one early beta
Beta Users and Validation
4:14
access optin landing page we began by
4:17
creating a simple landing page to start
4:19
adding people to the waiting list we
4:21
kept it super simple with a heading
4:24
subheading one field form and some
4:26
images and the form literally just said
4:29
enter your email email address keep me
4:30
in the loop and that was on the landing
4:32
page once the users filled out the form
4:34
they were taken to a type form survey
4:37
where we collected more information
4:39
about their business their current role
4:41
what's the biggest problem they're
4:43
facing with analytics what kind of
4:45
solution they're looking for which
4:47
products they're using or have used in
4:49
the past and the last step of the survey
4:52
was connected to a countly booking page
4:54
where we offered them to have an early
4:56
look inside the platform over a demo
4:58
call we received 96 survey submissions
5:02
and were able to book more than 30 demo
5:04
calls with Founders product managers and
5:06
marketing teams man oh my God this I'm
5:09
already I'm already so hyped by this
5:11
breakdown this breakdown is so in depth
5:14
oh my gosh and that's so smart what they
5:16
did moving people through that form to a
5:19
call where they demoed their product an
5:22
early version of their product and got
5:23
to learn through it oh my gosh this is
5:26
so cool this is so cool I'm so by this
5:30
so the author said the feedback we got
5:32
by talking to these people was
5:34
invaluable and helped us shape the
5:36
product in a much better way than we
Driving Traffic to Beta Access
5:38
thought step two getting traffic to the
5:40
beta access landing page now you might
5:43
be wondering how did we bring traffic to
5:45
our landing page we asked friends in the
5:48
industry to start with I reached out to
5:50
people I was connected to on various
5:52
social media platforms via DMS who fit
5:54
the ideal customer profile also Facebook
5:57
groups next I utilized various Facebook
6:00
groups related to software of service
6:02
businesses to generate more awareness
6:05
about what we were building here are a
6:07
few of those groups SAS growth hacks
6:10
30,000 Plus members SAS Founders which
6:13
is 13,000 Plus members SAS products and
6:16
marketing 23,000 Plus members SAS
6:19
Warriors 6.3 th000 members I'm actually
6:22
going to check out SAS growth tax sounds
6:24
like a great Facebook group and this is
Utilizing Social Media and Communities
6:26
what I posted to the Facebook group so
6:29
this is the exact copy that was used I
6:31
am looking to help some companies which
6:33
are having trouble setting up product
6:35
analytics at the end of this exercise
6:37
you will be able to see conversion rate
6:39
from visitor to sign up or trial to paid
6:42
attribute customer acquisition by Source
6:45
find where users are dropping off during
6:47
onboarding visualize important metrics
6:50
like da wou Maus there's so many metrics
6:55
here compare feature adoption and see
6:58
which feature SL modules your users love
7:01
the most get power users of your product
7:04
or a specific feature find slipping away
7:06
users use cohort analysis to measure
7:09
retention now you might be wondering
7:11
what's in it for me we'll set this up in
7:14
user maven.com which is a tool I've
7:16
specifically built for SAS product
7:18
analytics and if I am able to help and
7:21
you decide to continue using the tool
7:23
you'll be put on a special Founders plan
7:26
let me know if you're interested and
7:27
I'll send you the details so that was
7:29
was posted in these Facebook groups the
7:31
author writes the idea behind this post
7:33
was to provide assistance with setting
7:35
up analytics for as many people as
7:37
possible as we recognize that the
7:39
process can be challenging for many
7:41
individuals additionally I believed that
7:44
people generally preferred to receive
7:46
guidance and support when tackling
7:48
complex tasks and this is especially
7:50
true when it comes to setting up
7:52
analytics this was by far the best
7:54
channel for us they also did product
Exploring Other Platforms for Beta Users
7:56
hunt we tried a few other ways to get
7:58
more beta users first of those places
8:01
was product hunt ship where you can list
8:03
upcoming products that are in the making
8:05
product hunt ship has free and paid
8:08
plans we opted for the paid plan at $79
8:11
per month for one month and got 61 beta
8:13
subscribers from this promotion however
8:15
the quality of subscribers was
8:17
unsatisfactory for us because there were
8:20
more enthusiasts than Founders marketers
8:22
or other product people we were looking
8:24
for they use betalist which I talked
8:26
about I believe yesterday they say
8:27
betalist has a free and PID listing
8:30
option we opted for the $299 onetime
8:33
paid listing plan because we wanted to
8:35
skip the waiting queue and also get
8:37
featured in the newsletter so that
8:38
seemed like a good option but the
8:40
results were not convincing we only
8:42
received nine beta signups from betal
8:44
list which was disappointing because we
8:46
had better results from our previous
8:48
product listings there I had good
8:50
results with beta list because beta list
8:52
got me covered in relevant blogs which
8:54
for me it got me just such great
8:57
backlinks over and over again this
8:59
happened happened that was my experience
9:00
with betal list and occasionally because
9:03
I've done various launches occasionally
9:05
I would have launches that got a lot of
9:06
users they did Indie hackers and
9:08
actually I'm reading this on Indie
9:09
hackers so the author says another
9:12
initiative that I started but couldn't
9:13
keep up was to share our progress and
9:16
key Milestones on Indie Hacker's profile
9:19
I think there is a huge potential to
9:21
generate traffic and signups from Indy
9:23
hackers if you can share stories
9:25
Milestones growth hacks successes or
9:27
losses consistently to involve other
9:29
people in your journey the key to
9:32
success on Indie hackers is to be
9:34
consistent and share whatever knowledge
9:35
or learnings you come across during your
9:37
journey it was a shortcoming on my end
9:40
to not be able to post consistently on
9:42
Indie hackers and I definitely plan to
9:44
be more active there and then the last
9:46
one was slack communities we also tried
9:48
to get the word out in some of the slack
9:51
communities related to software as of
9:53
service and product L growth this also
9:55
worked really well because we were able
9:57
to make personal connections by
9:59
participating in the discussions and
10:01
then requesting permission from the
10:03
administrators to make a post inviting
10:05
beta users to our website a great list
10:08
of slack communities categorized by
10:10
niches can be found here and that link
10:13
will be in the description for this
10:15
episode so what really worked well for
10:17
them was slack communities and Facebook
10:20
groups and reaching out to friends in in
10:22
the industry and I like the message that
10:25
they used in the Facebook groups because
10:27
it was it just immediately got to to the
10:29
value that this provided C conversion
10:32
rate from visitor to sign up or trial to
10:34
pay it just listed all of these benefits
10:37
sell the benefits not the features so
Public Launch Strategy
10:40
now we get to the public launch public
10:42
launch with a special offer after doing
10:44
everything mentioned above user Maven
10:46
started getting some traffic but the
10:48
numbers were still low the traffic
10:50
spiked on some days when we did
10:52
something extra like posting in social
10:54
media groups sending a newsletter or if
10:56
someone else mentioned us on their
10:58
social media Prof file we had not yet
11:00
generated any Revenue because our
11:02
primary focus was on developing an
11:04
outstanding product and building an
11:06
audience prior to its release to the
11:07
public due to the fact that we did not
11:10
receive any outside investment we were
11:12
also very lean with our spending however
11:14
we realized that we need to do something
11:16
special in order to generate the funds
11:18
we need to grow further whether through
11:20
revenue or external investment as we
11:23
have been successful in bootstrapping
11:25
our previous products we didn't want to
11:27
pursue Venture Capital funding for user
11:29
Maven at this time so we had to quickly
11:31
find a good amount of customers and an
11:34
offer they can't refuse and that brought
11:36
us to think about doing an LTD AKA
11:40
lifetime deal the LTD campaign many
Executing the LTD Campaign
11:43
people in the SAS industry believe that
11:45
LTDs are a bad idea however in the past
11:48
few years we have seen a number of SAS
11:51
products including our own and LM list
11:53
instantly sales flare better proposals
11:57
find that lead expandi and many other
11:59
grew fine with recurring Revenue after
12:02
the lifetime deal that is why we decided
12:04
to do one quick LTD before starting the
12:07
Mr Journey the goal was to generate
12:10
enough Revenue to put the company in a
12:11
stable position for a year or more haste
12:14
up the development and spend on
12:16
marketing however we wanted to obtain
12:18
only a small number of Lifetime
12:20
customers who could provide useful
12:22
feedback become enthusiastic Advocates
12:25
and help us with Word of Mouth marketing
12:27
without overwhelming our ability to
12:29
support them over the long term there
12:32
are several different platforms to run
12:34
an LTD campaign with such as app Sumo
12:37
pitch ground SAS Mantra Prime lifetime
12:40
deals but we chose a different route and
12:43
that was running the lifetime deal on
12:46
our own without using any third-party
12:48
platform and we did this for three
12:50
reasons number one we didn't have to
12:52
share 30 to 70% of the revenue with
12:55
those platforms as per their terms 70%
12:58
is crazy number two we could manage
13:01
lifetime pricing plans and limits
13:03
according to the goal we had in mind our
13:05
highest plan was for
13:07
$999 and brought us the most Revenue
13:10
number three we got the payment directly
13:12
to our bank account and didn't have to
13:14
wait for 30 to 60 days here are the
13:17
steps We performed to run this campaign
13:19
we set up a long one-page landing page
13:21
that had everything we wanted to convey
13:23
to our audience the main components of a
13:26
successful landing page for a lifetime
13:28
deal are clear call to actions leading
13:30
to just one objective so purchase demo
13:33
video of the tool make the deal time
13:36
bound and add a timer limit the number
13:39
of codes you want to sell to create
13:41
urgency testimonials and lots of them if
13:44
available we got these from the beta
13:46
users pricing plans at least twice on
13:48
the page about us section mention who
13:51
are the people behind the product and
13:53
what's your long-term Vision if possible
13:55
add a camera facing recorded video to
13:57
add more trust fa Q section keep
14:00
updating this section as you get more
14:02
questions during the campaign once the
14:04
landing page for the lifetime deal was
14:06
ready The Next Step was to figure out
14:09
how are we going to bring traffic to it
14:11
here are a few things that we did first
Marketing and Revenue Generation
14:13
and foremost we informed the beta
14:15
subscribers we had that we had onboarded
14:17
and sent them a sequence of emails about
14:19
this campaign we found Facebook groups
14:22
where our lifetime customers hang out we
14:24
contacted the admins and gave some of
14:26
them special lifetime accounts to
14:28
promote in their groups so we didn't
14:30
have to share any Revenue there are lots
14:33
of amazing admins running these groups
14:35
and you'll be surprised to see how
14:37
helpful they can be for us the biggest
14:40
Revenue driving Facebook groups were
14:42
mtech wise SAS Warrior Canen move SAS
14:45
lifetime deals and life Teemo we sent an
14:48
email to our existing list of
14:50
subscribers from our other products
14:52
people hate cross promotion of products
14:54
so we kept this to a bare minimum three
14:57
emails in total to get the word out
14:59
without annoying those subscribers we
15:01
took to Twitter and started posting
15:03
about our product and deal in relevant
15:05
threads without being too spammy we were
15:07
able to reach our goal of $100,000 plus
15:10
dollars with the above channels so we
15:12
didn't explore other channels however if
15:14
we wanted to get more lifetime customers
15:16
and revenue we would have explored the
15:18
following channels Facebook ads
15:20
influencer Outreach on YouTube
15:22
onboarding Affiliates to promote our
15:24
product hting on relevant forums some
15:27
other important things to consider while
15:29
running an LTD campaign are prepare a
15:31
list of potential Q&A internally before
15:34
launching the campaign and keep adding
15:36
more as a campaign progresses this will
15:39
help answer the questions quickly over
15:41
support channels I actually do that for
15:43
all of my companies that's cool create
15:45
comparisons with similar tools in the
15:47
industry because you'll get a lot of how
15:49
does this compare with soand so type
15:52
queries be proactive on support channels
15:54
and help the users as much as you can
15:57
make sure the onboarding of the tool is
15:59
smooth to avoid extra burden on support
16:02
we worked a lot on this install an
16:05
Analytics tool from the start to track
16:07
user behavior and analyzing patterns we
16:09
were lucky that we had our own tool to
16:11
do this for us tweak your pricing plans
16:13
based on the feedback but make sure the
16:15
benefit versus cost makes sense and
16:18
don't accept everything because the LTD
16:20
Community brings a lot of
16:22
well-coordinated pressure we were quite
16:24
successful in hitting the numbers we
16:26
initially aimed for our initial goal was
16:28
to sell around 300 slots and make
16:30
$100,000 plus but we were able to make
16:34
$12,238 from 373 customers we offered a
16:39
30-day refund guarantee and had roughly
16:43
5.7% people do this so a 5.7% refund
16:47
rate which is well below the average
16:50
refund rate for Lifetime deal campaigns
16:52
giving us further confidence that
16:54
customers loved our product so we were
16:56
able to generate net revenue of
17:00
$3,414 from the LTD campaign if we look
17:04
at the website analytics we can clearly
17:06
see the impact of the campaign on the
17:08
traffic that it brought to our website
17:10
and it's just night and day before and
17:12
after overall the LTD campaign was
17:15
really an amazing experience and we're
17:17
super happy to have done it because of
17:19
the overwhelming amount of helpful
17:21
comments and support we received we now
17:23
have a wealth of resources ideas and use
17:26
cases to bring to the market in the near
17:28
future if if you are still in the early
17:30
stages of your company's development and
17:32
are struggling with getting new users
17:34
and have the feasibility to do an LTD
17:36
campaign I would strongly encourage you
17:39
to do so our journey beyond the LTD
Post-LTD Campaign Growth
17:42
campaign since we ran the LTD campaign
17:44
there has been a noticeable increase in
17:46
the number of visitors to our website
17:48
each and every month which is very
17:50
promising also we now have a solid road
17:53
map based on the feedback that re that
17:55
we received from the customers more
17:58
importantly we have been able to expand
18:00
our team from just three co-founders to
18:03
six people in the team that's why we
18:05
were able to Pace up our development and
18:07
we shipped more than 25 new features in
18:09
the past 2 and a half months making our
18:11
tool a solid competitor to mix panel for
18:13
product analytics and Google analytics
18:15
for web analytics with better privacy
18:18
focused and no code approach in the
18:20
analytics Market our mrr is currently at
18:23
$950 and a lot of new signups are on the
18:26
starter free forever plan but we think
18:28
that we'll be able to convert a good
18:30
percentage of those to the paid plans in
18:33
the near future by further enhancing the
18:35
value we provide in the paid plans we're
18:38
still working on perfecting both our
18:40
product and our marketing but we're
18:42
confident that we can compete with big
18:44
players like mix panel amplitude or even
18:47
Google analytics 4 which sucks we have a
18:50
vision and a solid team that will help
18:52
us achieve that and then there's an
